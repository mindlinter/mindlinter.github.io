I write code daily. I read about code daily. I have thought about present, news, technologies. And they come to nowhere. The best if I share them with colleagues, but I donâ€™t do it always.

Sometimes these thoughts are valuable, sometimes they are useless. But I will try to write up them. And I will see if it bring me to something. Once, this approach already worked. But you never know.

I plan that most of post will be short. And probably some platform for microblogging may suit better. But, we are in 2025. Elon Musk bought Twitter(or should we call it x.com), Threads are owned by Meta. Mastodon? Probably, but they are quite marginal. Not too many people read Mastodon.

And the most important, I will write for myself. I want ability to read this posts in the future and made self-reflection. That is why, it will be good old blogging on the technologies that I like: Astro + GitHub Pages. Will see how it goes.
