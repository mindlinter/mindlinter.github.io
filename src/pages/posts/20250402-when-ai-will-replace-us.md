There are a lot of hype around AI. And there are a lot of hype that AI will replace our jobs. 

"I think we will be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of the code. And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code," Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, said at a Council of Foreign Relations event on Monday. Anthropic developed Claude, a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. There is no doubt that their CEO will push for AI. And there is no doubt that it is overpromising. 

But if AI replaces Intellectual workers, when will it happen? 

Let’s take artists. Open AI released its image generation, which is very good. Fake Studio Ghibli flooded the internet. But, where is the next step? Why don’t we see huge amount of new cartoons?

What about software developers? Vibe coding is the trend. And if everything became so simple, why don’t we see millions of new startups? Millions of new applications? Millions of new websites?

AI is good at writing. It should help writers to be more productive. Why don’t we see an astonishing amount of new literature? 

Music. AI is average at music. It generates similar music by sound and genre. Nothing outstanding. But still, where is the boom in the music industry?

What about game development? It requires different people, artists, writers, musicians, and developers. But I don’t see huge amount of new games on Steam or at least on itch.io.

I don’t say that it will never happen, that AI will not replace jobs. In some way, it will. But before it happens we will see a **golden era for culture**. New cartoons, new books, new music, new games, new startups. Once I see it, I will conclude that it is happening. And it is time to switch to growing strawberries or beekeeping. And enjoy the new culture. But for now, it is too early.

There could be another point of view. The amount of the produced culture and software doesn’t rely on the amount that could be produced. The amount of the produced culture and software relies on the amount that could be consumed. Maybe we don’t need more books, more songs, more cartoons, more games, more software. Maybe, there is no free space for it and humanity doesn’t need more. If it is so, there will be no golden era. There will be **dark ages**, we will see mediocre AI everywhere. 

Which prediction is more realistic? Optimistic golden era or pessimistic dark ages?
