# Vibe coding

What a time! You don't often learn new skills, new methodology, new approach to the work.

I am a seasoned developer. I have written a lot of code, finished many projects, and mastered many skills. But now, my way of working has changed a lot. At least for the last two weeks.

I, actually, vibe coded the last two weeks. I write the instructions to the AI Agent, wait for the code, refactor it, and move to the next task. That is not a usual workflow. And I feel that it is more productive. 

I decided to work using this approach because I am working on the creation of MCP server. And if I am working on tools for AI, I should use AI. Because there is no point in working on something that you donâ€™t believe in.

It feels like automation of work. The tasks that AI is capable of doing, I automate with prompts. The tasks that AI is not capable of doing (or I am not skilled enough to explain the task to AI), I do by myself. Good old automation in a new appearance.
