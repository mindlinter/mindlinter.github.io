I continue playing with the MCP Server. And I am impressed. Very impressed. 
I have added more tools, and now AI is quite capable. Previously, it was hallucinating with suggestions on what to do and how, but with the addition of the MCP server, it does the right actions. I assume that it is because of the frames that are added by the MCP tools. 

Now, AI knows what exactly could be done and how. And there is no room for hallucinations.
So far, so good. And very promising, especially for niche technologies.
